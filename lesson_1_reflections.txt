How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
- helps finding typos
- mistake is often in the new parts when it worked before

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
- makes it possible to look and compare old to new code to e.g. see how you have improved
- lets you revert back to the old version if your "improvments" did not fulfill what they promised

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
- takes effort to manually commit
- risk of forgetting to commit
- risk of committing not enough/too much
- lets you save in logical steps
- you can best judge when it makes sense to commit

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
- depends on the domain of theier use: when writing plain text usually only one file is involed
- while in coding you often have several interdependant files

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
- use arrow down to scroll down and q to quit
- git log gives you all the commits with IDs, commit message and date
- git diff id1 id2 lets you compare the changes between two commits, + for addiotions and - deletes

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
- because you can always revert to previous versions that worked

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
- code. code. code and revert

changes between two documents:
from folder which holds both docs
diff -u old.file new.file

git diff is similar to diff.


git commands:
git log --stat 			git log with statistics about the files that changed
git diff #id1 #id2		compares two commits
git clone url 			clones the whole repository to the current directory
