- git push to load s.th. onto emote,
- git pull to download s.th. from remote, git pull origin master


When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- when accessing it from different locations/computers
- when colaborating

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- you often can't control who makes changes to the remote respository
- these changes might be wrong/unwanted etc.
